<style scoped>

/* Instead of styling the vue component files in css, we can just stlye it here:
We can do scope styling here. that way all the stuff we style here is scoped to this component
or any of the components that get created from this component.
Only the elements in this component will be styled and not others in the application. 

If we dont have the "scoped" in the element attribute, this styling will affect everything like it does in css.
